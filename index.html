   Bologna, the vibrant Italian city with a rich cultural heritage, has always been a center of brilliance. Tucked away in the heart of Emilia-Romagna, Bologna has been a hub for countless musicians and composers throughout its history. And among them, one name stands out more than the rest: Gioacchino Rossini. Diving into the MusicBo corpus allows one to dig deep into the connection between cities, especially Bologna, and the people who were part of the music scene in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was like going on a musical treasure hunt, unearthing the links between these cities and the talented folks who made the musical scene come alive. So, let's delve into Bologna's musical heritage, with a focus on how Rossini rocked its vibrant musical landscape. <br><br>
Bologna has been a sanctuary of musical magnificence for centuries and history cannot be told without exploring its artistic and intellectual mastery. And let's not forget the Grand Tour that kicked off in the 17th century, which brought a whole cultural exchange across all of Europe. Bologna was right in the middle of it all, embracing its role as a center of musical education. <br><br>
Let us now turn our attention to Gioacchino Rossini. In the early 19th century, this prodigious musician graced the city of Bologna with his presence, and it is undeniable that a remarkable transformation began. Rossini was already a big shot known for his jaw-dropping masterpieces. But when he stepped onto Bologna's stage, the city caught fire with a fresh, electrifying musical energy. People were hooked, both the audiences and the musicians themselves. These operas are still cherished today, such as the notable "Il Barbiere di Siviglia", captivating audiences with their timeless appeal. <br><br>
But Rossini wasn't just a local hero. His fame spread like wildfire beyond the borders of Bologna. Musicians and composers from all corners of the globe flocked to the city, eager to soak up its vibrant musical atmosphere and engage in a cultural exchange. This influx of talent and creativity turned Bologna into a melting pot of diverse musical influences. Also, people in many other cities in Italy were also blown away by Rossini's talent, with some even comparing him to a “1950s rock 'n' roll star, out to corrupt the minds of young,  
impressionable, and, yes, mostly female fans with his "physical" music”, as the MusicBo corpus shows. <br><br>
Bologna's musical heritage is a center of passion, creativity, and an undying love for the arts, and at its core stands Gioacchino Rossini, forever ingrained in the city's musical history. 
   But the musical journey doesn’t end with Rossini! In this captivating <a href="https://melody-data.github.io/stories/published_stories/story_1686593087.71216.html">story</a>, you’ll have the opportunity to explore the remarkable talent of other individuals who graced Bologna with their musical mastery. So, brace yourselves for a thrilling encounter with the diverse array of personalities that contributed to the musical tapestry of this extraordinary city!

 <br>
 <br> 
    <h1 class="sectionTitle" style="color: #2A85BC; width: 100%; margin-bottom: 3vh">Methodology</h1>
       <p style="padding-top: 5vh; margin-left: 90px; margin-right: 90px;">
              <b>1. Counters</b> <br>
Our initial purpose was to discover the frequency of people and cities mentioned in the MusicBo corpus. 
To construct the query, it was essential to determine the correct designation for the entity ‘person’ and ‘city’ within the Polifonia knowledge graph. 
To assist in this task, we utilized <a href="https://arco.istc.cnr.it/txt-amr-fred/">FRED</a>, a tool specifically designed to transform texts into a frame-based knowledge graph. 
The sentences inserted were: <br>
1. <i> Mozart is a person. </i> <br>
2. <i> Bologna is a city. </i> <br>
Here are the results: <br> 
              
<img src="img/fred1.png" style="width: 600px; height: auto;">
<img src="img/fred2.png" style="width: 600px; height: auto;">
                <br>

Then, we created the following queries, where the variables ?s stands for subject: <br>
  <img src="img/query10c.png" alt="quey10c"style="width: 400px; height: auto;">  
<img src="img/query10p.png" alt="query10p"style="width: 430px; height: auto;">  
   <br>

These queries retrieve all the people and cities cited in the corpus. The function (count(distinct ?s as ?count) provides us with the number of mentions without duplicates, as displayed in the pictures below: <br>
<img src="img/queryppl.png" alt="query people" style="width: 450px; height: auto;" >
<img src="img/querycity.png" alt="query cities"style="width: 450px; height: auto;">  
  <br>
  Once we ran the queries on Melody for the counter function, the results are displayed as follows: <br>
  <img src="img/counterpc.png" alt="Counter of the cities mentioned in MusicBo"style="width: 250px; height: auto;"> 
<br> 
<br> 
<b>2. Map </b> <br>
  To deepen our quantitative study, we decided to discover which cities were specifically mentioned. <br> After defining all map entities in the MusicBo corpus, we retrieved data about their geographical coordinates from the Wikidata knowledge graph. This was possible thanks to the SERVICE function, which allowed us to include data from the Wikidata endpoint and integrate it with MusicBo data in a single SPARQL query. This tool was particularly important in the creation of the story, as we were able to extend the capabilities of SPARQL and enrich our queries and to obtain more comprehensive results. <br> 

 <img src="img/querymap.png" alt="query map"style="width: 400px; height: auto;"> 
   <br> 
  The map below enables us to visualize the results, which show that most cities (1042) are located in Italy. <br>
  <img src="img/map.png" alt="Map"style="width: 650px; height: auto;">  
<br> 
 <br> 
<b>3. Charts</b> <br>
To further develop our research, we created a list of the most mentioned cities and people in the corpus. 
  The results are shown in a bar chart, which ranks each city and person based on their occurrences. <br>
         
<img src="img/queryp.png" style="width: 500px; height: auto;">
<img src="img/queryc.png" style="width: 450px; height: auto;"> 

   <br>
For those two queries, we used the "GROUP BY ?label ?count", which means that the query will generate groups where each group represents a unique combination of city label or person label 
   and its corresponding count, while the "ORDER BY DESC(?count)" ensures that the results are sorted from the highest count to the lowest count. Finally, the “LIMIT 10” provides only the first 10 results. <br>
   The queries’ results were the following: 

<br> 
    <img src="img/10c.png" alt="10c"style="width: 530px; height: auto;">  
    <img src="img/10p.png" alt="10p"style="width: 500px; height: auto;">  
  <br> 
   <br>
   
<b>4. Tables</b> <br>
   As in the previous function the results show Gioacchino Rossini as the most cited person, we decided to explore some aspects of his life. In order to do so, the Wikidata and Dbpedia knowledge graphs have proved to be very effective at retrieving extra information which was not available in the Polifonia knowledge graph. Once again, the SERVICE function was important for the creation of the tables’ queries, in particular to retrieve information about Rossini’s life and his notable works. 
For the first table we used the Wikidata endpoint, as shown in the following query. <br>
 <img src="img/wikirossini.png" alt="10p"style="width: 550px; height: auto;">  <br>
   To obtain the date of birth and death as years, we needed to define the date format. To achieve this, we included (year(?birthDate) as ?birthYear) and  (year(?deathDate) as ?deathYear) within the “SELECT DISTINCT” clause. These expressions extract the year component from the variable ?birthDate and ?deathDate, respectively, and assign them to new variables named ?birthYear and ?deathYear. <br>
While building the query, we added the “OPTIONAL” filter to include additional data if available, without preventing the query from generating results if the data is absent. However, our query returned all the variables that were set. <br>
An issue we encountered was that of language duplicates. This problem was solved thanks to the FILTER (lang(?label) = “en”) function, which ensured that only English labels are included in the results. This function was chosen over the other FILTER langMatches(lang(?label), “en“) as it also returned other variations of English such as “en-gb”, “en-us”, and so on. Instead, FILTER (lang(?label) = “en”) includes only those results that exactly match the set language condition. <br>
It was then necessary to include an “OFFSET” in order to refine the query. As displayed below, the initial query generated four results. By implementing this function, it was specified to skip the first three results and start from the fourth, which was the final entry. Therefore, the resulting table only displays one outcome. <br>

 <img src="img/offset.png" alt="offset"style="width: 800px; height: auto;"> 
<br>

   Here is the table as displayed on Melody: <br>
 <img src="img/rox.png" alt="offset"style="width: 600px; height: auto;">                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
<br>
   <br>
For the second table the chosen endpoint was DBpedia. We followed a “Treasure hunt” approach in order to find Rossini’s URI. Here is the query used: <br>
    <img src="img/dbpedia.png" alt="offset"style="width: 400px; height: auto;">  <br>
   The “FILTER regex” function allowed us to retrieve the label of all people whose name contains “Gioacchino” or “Rossini” (case-insensitive). 
   Once we found the URI, we were able to build a query that returned all of Rossini’s works, as well their premiere date. <br>
   Below you can find the query and the table. <br>
   <img src="img/querywork.png" alt="queryw"style="width: 550px; height: auto;"> <br> 
   <img src="img/works.png" alt="works"style="width: 550px; height: auto;">  
   <br>
 <br> 
   
<b>5. Chart</b> <br>  
   Our next objective was to discover the connection between Rossini and cities, which, perhaps, had been influenced by him and his melodies. Since we already had Rossini’s DBpedia URI, we decided to use it once again to explore the same knowledge graph. In the query Rossini was connected to a variable ?city, which in turn was defined in three triplets united by the UNION function. 
   This function is indeed useful whenever many resources and classes are found for the same concept, in this case “city”, and therefore to retrieve the most results out of the knowledge graph, as it combines all the results specified in each individual query into a single result set. 

   <br> 
   <img src="img/querymark.png" alt="querym"style="width: 400px; height: auto;">  
   <img src="img/mark.png" alt="mark"style="width: 600px; height: auto;">  <br> <br>


   
   <b>6. MusicBo corpus</b> <br> 
   After conducting research across various datasets, we interrogated the MusicBo corpus to find out the reasons behind Rossini's popularity. By searching for the keyword “Rossini” within the corpus, we discovered sentences that are particularly representative in this regard. <br>
   
 <img src="img/poli.png" alt="poli"style="width: 850px; height: auto;"> 
      <img src="img/sentences.png" alt="sentences"style="width: 700px; height: auto;">  
   <br> 
   Through the examination of these corpus sentences, we discovered that Rossini is widely acclaimed not only for the fame he achieved during his lifetime but also for the significant impact he had on subsequent musical heritage. <br>
This approach serves as a valuable method for gaining insight into the data extracted from the knowledge graphs and understanding the connections between them. <br> <br> 
      <b>7. Text search</b> <br>
  To further develop our story, we decided to add the text search feature, enabling our viewers to broaden their horizons by looking for other information concerning people within the MusicBo corpus that left a lasting mark in Bologna’s musical landscape. <br>
In this case, the query retrieves information about a person from the Wikidata endpoint based on a search term. It fetches the musician’s name, and if available, also the birth and death year, along with an associated image. We employed the “SERVICE” statement to establish a connection with the Wikidata endpoint, ensuring that the extracted results exclusively feature individuals from the Polifonia knowledge graph. The variable ?musician is associated with ?wiki, indicating that the search term should be matched with the musician’s name. Additionally, to ensure the query results are in English, the SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en".}
was added. <br>

<img src="img/textsearch.png" alt="txtsrch"style="width: 600px; height: auto;">  <br>
   As you can see from the results, by searching for a musician name such as Mozart, it shows the available data. <br>   
<img src="img/mozart.png" alt="mozart"style="width: 550px; height: auto;">  <br>
We could have added some other data, like the birth place or the death place, but as there were too many variables, everytime we ran the query on the Polifonia endpoint there was a “proxy error”. <br>

With 135 texts, the MusicBo corpus unveils the rich and fascinating Bologna’s musical heritage of Bologna. Following both a quantitative and qualitative approach, this  <a href="https://melody-data.github.io/stories/published_stories/story_1687277754.778511.html">story</a> explores the vibrant connections between musicians and organizations mentioned in the MusicBo corpus. The goal is to highlight the multifaceted influences that have shaped the city's musical culture. Get ready to discover the fascinating world of Bologna's music scene! <br> <br> 
307 are the music organizations mentioned in the MusicBo corpus, ranging from music schools and academies to churches and operas. Bologna, as one of Italy’s major cultural centers, has been a fertile ground for hundreds of influential institutions. These organizations, from classical academies to the iconic Cathedral of San Petronio, have left an indelible mark on the city’s musical heritage, each with its unique story. Among them, one institution shines brightest – the Philharmonic Academy of Bologna. Established in 1666, this prestigious academy played a pivotal role in the Bolognese music panorama, boasting illustrious members such as composer Giacomo Antonio Perti and violinist Giuseppe Torelli. <br><br>
Speaking of violinists, our journey into the XVIII century music scene reveals their remarkable prominence. The violin, cherished for its harmonious qualities, took center stage in classical music. Compared to other musicians like pianists, flutists, guitarists, violists, and drummers, violinists held a special place of importance and were highly required. <br> <br>
Our exploration takes us beyond Bologna’s borders to uncover the geographical distribution of violinists during the XVIII century. Europe emerges as the primary hub for violinists, with France, England, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Italy hosting a significant number of these talented musicians. Influenced by historical events, the presence of violinists blossomed between the XVII and XVIII centuries, leaving a significant footprint on the international music scene. <br> <br>
But don’t let your exploration end here… Stay curious, that's how you learn! Getting to know the influential violinists is a wonderful way to understand and appreciate those who have shaped our cultural landscape.

    <p style="padding-top: 5vh; margin-left: 90px; margin-right: 90px;">
    <b>The basis</b> <br>

As already stated, the primary aim of this project is to offer an overview of the MusicBo corpus and promote the rich musical heritage of Bologna. Following the initial exploration of people and cities mentioned in the corpus, we have decided to expand the project’s scope by delving into other entities that deserve recognition and attention. <br>
To determine the subject of this story, we created a query that presents all the types of entities mentioned in the corpus. By using the “ORDER BY DESC'' function, the results are arranged in descending order, providing insight into the frequency of each entity type within the corpus. This enabled us to identify and prioritize the different types of entities based on their occurrence in the corpus. <br> 
 <img src="img/basis.png" alt="offset"style="width: 450px; height: auto;">       <br>
By examining the data, we determined that the organizations were worthy of exploration for our storytelling. <br> <br>

    <b>1. Counter </b> <br>
   The initial step of this research involved identifying the total number of organizations mentioned in the MusicBo corpus. As indicated by the picture below, the count revealed a total of 307 organizations. <br>
 <img src="img/organiz.png" style="width: 180px; height: auto;"> <br>
To gain insight into the specific organizations mentioned, the variables in the “SELECT DISTINCT” clause can be replaced with ?slabel. This modification allows for the discovery of the actual organizations’ names, revealing that they mainly consist of academies and music schools. Here is the running query: <br>
 <img src="img/organizcount.png" style="width: 500px; height: auto;"> 
<br><br>
   
 <b>2. Chart </b> <br>

   Secondly, we narrowed our research to the top 10 most cited organizations in the corpus. However, when running the query, the results showed us “JSTOR” as one of the main organizations: this is clearly an error. <br>
 <img src="img/jstor.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto;"> <br>

Therefore, we added the FILTER (!regex(str(?label), "jstor",'i')), used to delete an element from the list. This way the shown results were all relevant to the research. <br>
 <img src="img/10orgcount.png" style="width: 450px; height: auto;"> <br>

 <img src="img/10org.png" style="width: 500px; height: auto;"> <br>

<br> <br>
   
 <b>3. Table </b> <br>
   
To gain deeper insight into the organizations in Bologna, we created a query that uses the “SERVICE <https://query.wikidata.org/bigdata/namespace/wdq/sparql>” statement to retrieve information about the foundation year from Wikidata. 
To focus exclusively on the organizations located in Bologna, we introduced the variable ?cityUri, which is defined as an instance of amr:City.
Additionally, we assigned a label to the city and filtered the results using the “FILTER regex (?label, "Bologna", "i")” statement. This ensures that only cities with the label containing “Bologna” are included in the query results. <br>
  Once we obtained the results, we noticed that the entity 'San Petronio' was associated with two foundation dates.  <br>
   <img src="img/1350.png" style="width: 800px; height: auto;"> <br>
  <br>
  Consequently, we did a search to disambiguate the results. It turned out that 1350 was the birthdate of the organization's founder, not the foundation date of the organization itself. Therefore, we included the “FILTER (YEAR(?foundationDate) != 1350) to eliminate the unrelated result. <br>
   <img src="img/qtableorg.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto;"> <br>
   <img src="img/tableboloorg.png" style="width: 800px; height: auto;"> 
<br> <br>
   
 <b>4. Chart </b> <br>
In order to learn more about the organizations in Bologna and their occurrences in the MusicBo corpus, we ranked them through the use of the doughnut chart. Below you can find the query and the chart. <br>
   <img src="img/qboloorg.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto;"> <br>

   <img src="img/chartboloorg.png" style="width: 600px; height: auto;"> 
  <br><br>
  
 <b>5. Table </b> <br>
  Since the doughnut chart results proved that “Accademia Filarmonica” (Philharmonic Academy) is the most cited organization of Bologna, we decided to explore this entity through the use of the ArCo knowledge graph. This contains interesting information about the Philharmonic Academy’s building, such as the construction date, the cultural scope and its architectural layout. 
To create the query, we initially referred to the <a href="https://catalogo.beniculturali.it/">Catalogo dei Beni Culturali </a> to gather additional information about the organization. 
  On the website, we discovered the <a href="https://catalogo.beniculturali.it/detail/ArchitecturalOrLandscapeHeritage/0800264156">page</a> dedicated to the organization's building, which provided a link to the <a href="  https://dati.beniculturali.it/lodview-arco/resource/ArchitecturalOrLandscapeHeritage/0800264156.html">RDF page</a> of the entity.

   <b>6. MusicBo Corpus and table</b> <br>
  For a more detailed research, we proceeded to interrogate the MusicBo corpus on the Philharmonic Academy of Bologna, allowing us to find Giuseppe Torelli. <br>
   <img src="img/corpus.png" style="width: 800px; height: auto;"> <br>

Therefore, we worked on providing an overview of Giuseppe Torelli through the following query: <br>
   <img src="img/qtorelli.png" style="width: 700px; height: auto;"> <br>
  
  As can be seen from the musician's wikidata page, there are four occupations associated with him.
<br>
   <img src="img/occupation.png" style="width: 700px; height: auto;"> <br>
  
  However, we want to focus exclusively on his career as violinist, so we added the “FILTER (regex (?occupation, "violinist"))” statement. 
Here is the final table on Melody: <br>
   <img src="img/torelli.png" style="width: 700px; height: auto;"> <br>
  <br><br>
  
<b>7. Counters </b> <br>
To give a more in-depth analysis of the role of violinists in the music scene of the XVIII century, we conducted an examination of various types of musicians. Since we wanted to focus on a specific century, we set the violinists' date of birth with the "FILTER (YEAR(?birthDate) > 1699 && YEAR(?birthDate) < 1800  )" statement. Through the use of counters, we were able to gather quantitative data that clearly demonstrated the elevated presence of violinists. These findings allowed us to show that violinists were of great importance and much more required compared to other musicians.

  <img src="img/counters2.png" style="width: 200px; height: auto;"> 
  <br><br>
  
<b>8. Line chart</b> <br>
We decided then to conduct a diachronic study to show the rise of violinists’ popularity over the years. Our focus was on a specific timeframe, which goes from the middle of the XVII century to the beginning of the XIX century. Therefore, we included the following filter: “FILTER (YEAR(?date) > 1649 && YEAR(?date) < 1801)”. <br>
  While creating the query to achieve the desired results, we encountered some issues. In fact, the first query specified the date format (year (xsd:dateTime(?date)) as ?label) within the “SELECT DISTINCT” statement. However, the results were full of duplicates, as displayed in the image below: 
<br>
    <img src="img/duplicates.png" style="width: 700px; height: auto;"> 
  <br>
  This issue was solved by adding the BIND function to extract the year within the query. ​​In simple terms, the BIND keyword is used to assign a value to a variable. It allows to create a new variable and assign a specific value or expression to it, which can then be used in subsequent parts of the query. In the provided query, the BIND keyword is used to create a new variable called ?year and assign it the value of the year component of a date.
Here is the final query and the line chart on Melody:

   <img src="img/timeline.png" style="width: 700px; height: auto;"> 
  <br><br>
  <b>9. Map</b> <br>
  Our research was then directed to learning about the country of citizenship of the violinists from the XVIII century: this is a data that can be perfectly illustrated by the map function. Thus, we generated this query:
<br>
  <img src="img/qviolmap.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto;"> 
  <br>
  The query gave us back the following map: <br>
  <img src="img/mapviolinists.png" style="width: 700px; height: auto;"> 
<br><br>
    <b>10. Text search</b> <br>
To extend the study about other important violinists, the text search function has been added. The query was used to gather information about violinists born in a specific city and is performed on the Wikidata endpoint. However, we used the “SERVICE” to ensure that the results only included individuals from the Polifonia knowledge graph. 
<br>
 <img src="img/qvioltxtsearch.png" style="width: 600px; height: auto;"> <br>
  By writing the name of a city, it is possible to find out the biographical information of violinists from that city and see an image depicting them. For instance, by entering “Paris” on the search term function, the results show some violinists born there.

Among the 421 composers shaping Bologna’s vibrant music culture, a notable discovery emerged — 10 composers hailing from Russia. 
   In this <a href="https://melody-data.github.io/stories/published_stories/story_1687714706.423208.html">story</a> , we delve into the lives and contributions of these Eastern composers.  <br><br>
Surprisingly, Frédéric Chopin, originally from Poland but born during the time when it was part of the Russian Empire, is counted among the Russian composers in the MusicBo corpus. It's a fascinating reflection of how artistic influences transcended national boundaries in those dynamic times. However, it is the group known as "The Five" that truly captivates our attention. Comprising five prominent Russian composers—Mily Balakirev, Alexander Borodin, César Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov—they formed a united circle, revolutionizing Russian classical music in the 19th century. <br><br>
The inclusion of these Eastern composers in documents related to Bologna's musical history speaks volumes about the city's significance as a hub for musicians. Bologna, with its enduring appeal and its ability to attract diverse musical talents from around the world, became the center of artistic excellence. <br><br>
Thanks to the influential group known as The Five, Russia experienced a musical revolution in the 19th century. Their innovative compositions and nationalistic approach left an indelible mark on the musical landscape of not only Russia but also the entire world. However, their impact extended far beyond the 19th century, as the legacy of The Five continued to resonate among composers in the Soviet Union. Their innovative spirit and commitment to Russian cultural identity inspired a new generation of musicians to explore and push the boundaries of classical music. Composers such as Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitry Shostakovich, and Igor Stravinsky emerged as prominent figures, carrying forward the revolutionary ideals of their predecessors. <br><br>

Classical music in the 19th century was a force to be reckoned with. It was a time of grand symphonies, passionate operas, and virtuosic performances. The music of composers swept across concert halls and captivated audiences with its emotional depth and technical brilliance. The 19th century was an era when classical music reached new heights, leaving an indelible mark on the cultural landscape and shaping the future of music as we know it. <br><br>
In conclusion, the 19th century was an extraordinary period in music history, filled with a vast array of talented composers whose works continue to captivate and inspire us today. The depth and diversity of musical voices during this era are truly remarkable. <br>
While we have touched upon some of the well-known composers of the 19th century, there are countless others whose contributions deserve recognition and exploration. So, let your curiosity guide you as you embark on your own musical journey through the remarkable world of 19th-century composers.

    <b>1. Counter</b> <br>
Firstly, in order to have a foundation from which we could build our study, we needed to discover the number of worldwide composers, from the 1800s on, in the MusicBo corpus. We achieved this through the interrogation of the Polifonia knowledge graph, starting from the exploration of the Polifonia class “Person”.
However, there was no way to define the 'has occupation composer' predicate, so we had to use the Wikidata endpoint through the SERVICE function. Finally, to remove language duplicates we employed FILTER(lang(?label) = “en”), which gave us only one English variant for each single result. 
The structuring of the query required the following steps: <br>

 <img src="img/querycounter.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: auto;"> <br>

Once we ran the query on Melody for the counter function, the given result was the following:<br>

  <img src="img/counter1.jpg" style="width: 180px; height: auto;"> 
   <br>
   <br>

   <b>2. Map</b> <br>
   From knowing how many composers are mentioned in the corpus, we moved to exploring where these composers can be specifically found. We started from the previous query and added to the person the Wikidata property “country of citizenship” in order to find their position in the world. Here is the query: <br>

    <img src="img/querymap.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: auto;">
     <img src="img/worldmap.jpg" style="width: 550px; height: auto;"> 
   <br>
   <br>
   
   <b>3. Doughnut chart</b> <br>
   Having a particular interest in the development of classical music in Russia, we narrowed our research to the top 10 most cited Russian composers in MusicBo. The doughnut chart ranks the composers, from the most mentioned to the least mentioned one, based on their occurrences in the corpus. Once again, we started from the counter query and added a UNION function uniting two triplets that defined the person as having an origin from either Russia or the Russian Empire, since we were not sure to which country people in the 18th-19th century belonged. Below you can find the query and the doughnut chart. <br>

     <img src="img/querydchart.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: auto;"> 
     <img src="img/dchart.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: auto;">
   <br>
   <br>
   
    <b>4. MusicBo corpus</b> <br> 
   In addition, we explored the MusicBo corpus to find more information about the group of Five. In fact, searching for composers' names as keywords, we found several sentences. It was thanks to these sentences that we discovered their significance and profound impact on the triumph of classical compositions in Russia.<br>
     <img src="img/balakirev.jpg" style="width: 700px; height: auto;"> <br>
     <img src="img/textsentencerus.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: auto;">
   <br>
   <br>

   <b>5. Table</b> <br>
   To give a more in-depth analysis, our focus moved to analyzing 5 of the 10 most mentioned Russian composers, since, through the interrogation of the MusicBo corpus, we found out they are part of the same composition group: The Five or The Mighty Five. 
We then created a query that could give us back a table displaying some of the life’s 
aspects of these noteworthy composers.
We started the query with the SERVICE function, since we already had found the Wikidata entity for The Five, as well as its properties. The OPTIONAL statement was used, since we could not be sure that the information we were looking for in Wikidata would be available, therefore we wanted to have the results returned nonetheless for each member. An issue we encountered, however, was specifying the occupation of each member, since we wanted to focus on just one interesting occupation per composer that did not deal with music. Therefore the FILTER regex function was used to limit the results. Finally, we initially added a “Place of death” variable, but the Polifonia returned a “Proxy error”. By simplifying the query, that is by removing a variable, the problem was solved. <br>

     <img src="img/querytable.jpg" style="width: 550px; height: auto;"> <br>

   As you can see from the results, by searching for the composers, it shows the available data for each of them:<br>

     <img src="img/tableru.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: auto;"> <br>
    <img src="img/tableru2.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: auto;">
   <br>
   <br>

   <b>6. Sound table </b><br>
   While exploring the Wikidata page of The Five, we were able to find an audio source of one of their compositions, which we thought would be interesting to add in order to deepen our knowledge about the chosen theme. Interestingly, the audio player would work fine on Google Chrome, but on Safari it did not. <br>

    <img src="img/querytableaudio.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: auto;"> 
    <img src="img/tableaudio.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: auto;"> 
   <br>
   <br>

   <b>7. Counter</b> <br>
   To better explore the Russian musical landscape of the 19th century, we chose to create a query showing the number of composition groups existing at that time. 

While we were exploring the results, even though we added in the query the predicate “has origin in Russian Empire” (?composer ?origin wd:Q34266.), we noticed that there were many results not relevant to the research. For this reason, we applied the FILTER (!regex(str(?label), in order to exclude certain labels that contain specific keywords such as “American”, “Swedish”, “Soviet”, and “USSR”. <br>

  <img src="img/querycounter2.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: auto;"> 
     <img src="img/counter2.jpg" style="width: 180px; height: auto;"> 
   <br>
   <br>

   <b>8. Linechart </b><br>
   Our focus then shifted to works of art composed in Russia, in order to show the variation in time after the influence of classical music in the 1800s. The work of art variable was defined as being composed by an author, who had the citizenship “Russian Empire” used previously. 
One of the problems that we encountered in this query was that of year duplicates. We solved this problem by using once again the BIND function to extract the year within the query.
Moreover, initially a FILTER was added to include only results from the 19th century, but then we noticed that with or without the FILTER the results were the same. This is because of the “has origin in Russian Empire” variable definition, which already defined the time. Finally, we had to add the OFFSET 1 keyword at the end of the query, as the first result returned in Polifonia was empty. Because of this null result, the query did not run correctly on Melody. 

This variation in time of the Russian works of art can be displayed in the best way by a line chart, for which we created the following query: <br>

  <img src="img/querylinechart.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: auto;"> <br>
   
   Here is the line chart. You can’t see the years since they are too many, but once you click on them, they are visible: <br>

     <img src="img/linechartru.jpg" style="width: 550px; height: auto;">
   <br>
   <br>

   <b>9. Textsearch </b> <br>
   Finally, we went back from specific to international by adding a Textsearch that could reveal various composers based on the city they were from. 
The problems encountered in the creation of this function were of various nature. In fact, we were constantly faced with a Proxy Error, because of which we had to simplify our query. Firstly, we noticed that the occupation “composer” we assigned to the variable was one of the first issue noticed, therefore we had to find a Wikidata property common to all composers. The triplet “?composer - has genre - classical music” worked. Secondly, our initial purpose was to define the "searchterm" as a country and not a city. However, this led to a more complicated query, since we had to define the composer’s place of birth and its related country. Once again, we simplified the query by only using the place of birth. Finally, since we did not have the Wikidata property “has origin in Russian Empire”, we 
added a time FILTER. <br>

<p style="padding-top: 5vh; margin-left: 90px; margin-right: 90px;">
In conclusion, our project has shed light on the remarkable cultural legacy and international impact of Bologna's music scene. Through the power of knowledge graphs and the exploration of the MusicBo corpus, we have discovered information about influential composers, notable musicians, and cultural organizations that have shaped the city's musical panorama. 
Thanks to this exploration, we were able to discover authors who had a great impact on Bologna's musical heritage, but were often left in oblivion, such as Torelli.
By deepening our understanding and appreciation of Bologna's rich musical heritage, we hope to stimulate the passion for music in all its forms. This research serves to uncover the hidden gems of Bologna's musical history. 
Let the melodies and stories guide you through the vibrant tapestry of Bologna's musical past, and may this project ignite a sense of wonder and appreciation for the power of music to transcend time and connect people across borders. <br>
